         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas the Army under my Conduct, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> is to advance into <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the grounds, and for the ends expre≈ø≈øed in their Declaration of <hi>Iune</hi> 26. 1650. And con≈øidering the ≈øeveral ways and practi≈øes of ≈øome in that Kingdom, who≈øe de≈øign it hath been, and ≈øtill is, by all maner of groundle≈øs and unju≈øt Reproaches, and mo≈øt fal≈øe Slanders, to make the Army odious, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us unto the people, as ≈øuch that are to be abhorred of all pious, peaceable and ≈øober Spirits, and to be rather Mon≈øters then Men.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:165692:3"/>
            <p>VVe think fit therefore, for the clearing of our ≈øelves, to reminde you of our former deportment and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, when about two years ≈øince we entred into the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then carryed in by the Hand of Divine Providence, and through the earne≈øt Invitation of tho≈øe now in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Authority and Power with you, VVhat injury or wrong did we then do, either to the per≈øons, Hou≈øes or Goods of any? <hi>Who≈øe Ox have we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</hi> Did we ≈øeek any thing for our ≈øelves? Did we other then pre≈øerve the be≈øt affected from; their and our mo≈øt de≈øperate enemies? And having e≈øtabli≈øhed our Inviters in their power without doing the lea≈øt violence to any, we returned to our own Nation.</p>
            <p>And con≈øidering this, we have cau≈øe to hope, That tho≈øe former carriages
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165692:3"/>of ours are not ≈øo ≈øoon forgotten; and that the pre≈øent Mi≈øreports of what our dealings will be, ≈øhall not di≈øturb, nor affright the people from their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and dwellings.</p>
            <p>And for ≈øatisfaction of all tho≈øe that are Lovers of Religion, Peace and Publique Liberty, and being de≈øirous to put a difference between the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and the Guilty; VVe do hereby Declare, in the Integrity of our hearts, That as to the Gentry and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who≈øe Habitations are in tho≈øe places, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Army by the providence of God may come, <hi>As we know full well they are not the Per≈øons, who by their Councels and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ndertakings have laid the certain foundation of a ≈øecond unrighteous and unju≈øt Invasion of</hi> England, <hi>by clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing with, and entertaining of Him, who

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165692:4"/>we ≈øhall not (the Lord continuing his goodne≈øs and pre≈øence to us) offer the lea≈øt violence and injury to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, goods or po≈ø≈øe≈øsions of any of them, but ≈øtrive and labor to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt to prevent all di≈øorders that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from an Army, and to give all ≈øpeedy Redre≈øs and Satisfaction that po≈øsibly may be, when any ju≈øt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Miscarriage ≈øhall be made.</p>
            <p>And upon the Confidence of the≈øe our ≈øincere and hone≈øt intentions (which we hope our good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God will enable us to perform;) VVe do hereby INVITE all ≈øuch per≈øons to ≈øtay and abide in their own Hou≈øes and Habitations, where they may and ≈øhall enjoy what they have in peace; and not to ≈øuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to be mi≈ø-led by the craft and
